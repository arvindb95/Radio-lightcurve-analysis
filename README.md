# Radio-lightcurve-analysis
This repo deals with work that I have been carrying out at Texas Tech University on studying radio lightcurves of compact object mergers and supernovae. make_lc_plots.py does an MCMC fit to radio lightcurves for the so called "cocoon" model for neutron star mergers. plot_SN_lc.py is a code to make a nice panel plot of lightcurves at different observation frequencies.
